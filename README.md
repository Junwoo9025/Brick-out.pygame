# Overview

{Learning how to use pygame, I was able to learn that I can use python to develop a simple game. Pygame offered a range of features that can help me to learn the basics of game development, including graphics, sound, and input handling. Especially, I became more familiar with Python. I hope to make more games in the future.}

{This is a game about breaking the bricks. I used pygame to make this game. Goal of this game is to break all of the bricks and once you hit 1000 scores then event time happens, so that you have extra ball for 10 seconds in a lower speed so that you can accruately hit the bricks.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
